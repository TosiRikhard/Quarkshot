# Quarkshot

## Overview

Quarkshot is a proof-of-concept application that introduces a novel approach to screen capture and composition. Unlike traditional screenshot tools, Quarkshot aims to capture individual windows and screen elements as separate layers, allowing for post-capture manipulation of the screen composition.

## Core Concept

The key idea behind Quarkshot is to deconstruct the screen into its component parts (windows and UI elements) during capture, and then allow the user to reconstruct or modify the scene afterward. This approach opens up new possibilities for screen capture and sharing.

## Current Features (Proof of Concept)

- Capture individual windows as separate elements
- Save captured images as PNG files
- Basic display of captured window thumbnails

## Technology Stack

- Avalonia UI for cross-platform UI development
- MVVM Toolkit for architectural pattern implementation
- C# for backend logic
- Windows API (via P/Invoke) for screen capture functionality

## Limitations

As an early proof of concept, Quarkshot currently has significant limitations:

- Windows-only functionality for screen capture
- Limited error handling and user feedback
- Basic file management for saved images
- No implementation yet of layer manipulation features
- Potential issues with capturing certain types of windows (e.g., hardware-accelerated content)

## Future Potential

With further development, Quarkshot could evolve into a powerful tool for screen capture, composition, and presentation. Potential features include:

1. **Layer Manipulation**: Implement controls to adjust the visibility, Z-order, and position of captured window layers.

2. **Composition Editor**: Develop a user-friendly interface for reconstructing and modifying the captured screen layout.

3. **Selective Capture**: Allow users to choose specific windows or screen regions for capture.

4. **Real-time Preview**: Provide a live preview of layer adjustments as users modify the composition.

5. **Export Options**: Enable exporting of manipulated compositions as images or in a format that preserves layer information.

6. **Template System**: Create and save composition templates for quick application to new captures.

7. **Smart Arrangement**: Implement algorithms to suggest optimal arrangements of captured windows.

8. **Annotation and Highlighting**: Add tools for emphasizing or explaining parts of the captured composition.

9. **Version History**: Track changes to the composition and allow users to revert to previous states.

## Potential Use Cases

- Creating clean, reorganized screenshots for documentation
- Preparing visually optimized screen compositions for presentations
- Collaborative troubleshooting where screen layouts can be easily shared and modified
- User interface design and prototyping
- Creating custom multi-window workspace layouts

Quarkshot represents an innovative approach to screen capture and composition. While currently limited in implementation, it lays the groundwork for a new category of tools that treat screen captures not as static images, but as dynamic, manipulable compositions.
